Mini Card Game — Pokémon Cards (HTML/CSS/JS)

A tiny, fast, and responsive mini card game made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It shows 4 different Pokémon-style cards that change as you move the cursor left ↔ right. The stacking order uses z-index to bring different cards to the front.

Built for beginners: no frameworks, just a single index.html + styles.css + app.js.

✨ Features

. 4 distinct Pokémon cards (e.g., Fire, Water, Grass, Electric).

. Cursor-controlled reveal: Moving left ↔ right cycles which card is on top.

. Smooth stacking with CSS z-index + subtle transforms.
